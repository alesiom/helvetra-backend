"""
B2B usage-alert dispatch.

After each successful B2B translation we check whether the customer
has just crossed an alert threshold (80% or 100% of their included
monthly quota). Each threshold fires at most once per billing period
thanks to per-period flags on the usage_periods row.

Sending happens via the existing SMTP service; SMTP failures fail
soft so the translation response is never delayed or blocked.
